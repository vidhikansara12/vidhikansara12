# Hi, I'm Vidhi 👋
a grad student in CS Python-first engineer building data pipelines, APIs, and applied ML systems.

I like projects that start as messy real-world requirements and end as something you can run, test, and explain.

---

## What I focus on
- **Python for data + automation**: preprocessing, feature engineering, evaluation, ETL-style pipelines
- **APIs & systems**: REST services that integrate data + ML/AI components
- **Applied AI**: NLP/LLMs, intent detection, voice interfaces, and practical ML modeling

## Featured Projects

### 1) AIRS — EEG Cognitive Perception Prediction (Python)
**Goal:** Predict cognitive perception categories (agency, motivation, utility) from EEG signals during HCI tasks.  
**What I built:** Python feature engineering pipeline (frequency-band power), trained/evaluated ML models (RF, XGBoost, etc.), and automated an end-to-end workflow so non-programmers can run experiments.  
**Highlights:** strong validation performance + reproducible pipeline.

### 2) VitaVoice — Voice-enabled Health Companion (App + AI)
**Goal:** Elderly-care assistant with voice interaction + chatbot for reminders, engagement, and support workflows.  
**What I owned:** team lead for user stories (Agile/Jira/Confluence) + developer work on AI/ML integration + app setup and core flows.

### 3) Rakshika — Women Safety App (Backend + ML + IoT)
**Goal:** Safety app with SOS workflow, evidence capture, live location, and multimodal detection.  
**My contributions:** worked on the Flutter frontend components in a team setting (project originated as a hackathon build).

### 4) Smart Campus — AI-driven Campus App
**Goal:** Campus navigation + IoT data + event-driven workflows (routing + dashboards).
